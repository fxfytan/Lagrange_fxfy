I combine 7 years of academic research experience with narrative craft to cover obscure or complex subjects in a compelling and accessible way. 
In collaboration with non-profits, startups and businesses, and institutions, I've written newsletter features, thought leadership pieces, profiles, blogs, and other forms of copy.
