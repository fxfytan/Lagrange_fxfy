Besides freelance non-fiction and journalism, I also offer the following services:

## Content writing
I've produced sharp profiles and extensively-researched features, newsletters and blogs for clients. I've tackled a wide range of specialized and interdisciplinary subject matter in the science and technology space, from the history of glia biology to multi-physics AI models. I'm also comfortable writing about science and technology in conjunction with humanities, art, and the social sciences. 

## Scientific writing, editing, and consulting
As an academic researcher and Caltech Ph.D., I've published peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts and literature reviews, and significantly contributed to successfully-funded private and federal grant applications. My specific research expertise is in the biological sciences, including areas such as regeneration and stem cell biology, developmental biology, cardiac biology, immunology, metabolism, and general animal physiology and evolution. I am also available to consult with startups interested in regeneration biology and adjacent applications (e.g. aging, stem cell biology, inflammation).

## Research and data analysis
I bring 7+ years of research with experience in both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. I've worked with large, complex datasets in scientific research, and was involved in survey design and distribution as a peer advocate for chronically ill, disabled, and neurodivergent students in graduate school.\
I can produce statistical analyses, data visualizations in Python and R, and complete research reports with a summary and discussion of findings.

## Speaking
I've fielded numerous questions about science communication as a graduate student, and am available for speaking engagements on:\
-- Careers in science communication\
-- How to communicate your research effectively\
-- Exploring science communication as a graduate student\
These talks are generally targeted at a graduate student/postdoc audience, but please reach out if you have a subject in mind.

## Graduate school application review
I've written a successful personal statement (6/9 acceptances) that was positively remarked on by faculty during interviews. I've also helped peers with their successful applications for graduate programs in the biological sciences as well.\
I am available to:\
-- Workshop and edit a draft of a personal statement\
-- Review your academic experience and work with you to craft a statement that conveys your expertise effectively\
-- Go over the interview process: elevator-pitch your research experience and ideas, thoughtful answers about why you want to be in graduate school etc.\

NOTE: I **will not** write a personal statement from scratch for you. This is a collaborative process. \
Grad school apps can be incredibly confusing to navigate, and I wouldn't have been able to do so without mentorship.
I plan to set aside a number of free or low-cost consults for trans/queer POC applicants for the '24-'25 cycle.
