Felyx Fayth Tan (they/them) is an independent science writer and researcher based in Pasadena, CA. If they could be an animal, they'd be a lungfish because they like waking up to the sound of rain.

They write about the stories we tell ourselves about scienceâ€” how we construct them, who gets to tell them, how our fears, anxieties, hopes and passions inexorably bleed into it. They've been recognized by the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/national-academies-announce-inaugural-recipients-of-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-awards-for-excellence-in-science-communications-totaling-600000/) for [two](https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/orchids-science-and-culture) [essays](https://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-californiahttps://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-california), winning the Schmidt Award for Excellence in Science Communication in 2022. The rest of their writing can be found [here](https://fxfy.github.io/writing).

They were a developmental biologist at Caltech, and graduated with a Ph.D. in Biology in June 2023. Their thesis research was in animal regeneration from an evolutionary-developmental perspective, studying how animals make and re-make themselves.
