Hi! I’m Felyx and/or Fayth. I’m an independent science writer and researcher based in Pasadena, CA. If I could be an animal, I'd be a lungfish because I like waking up to the sound of rain.

My writing is typically about the stories we tell ourselves about science— how we construct them, who gets to tell them, how our fears, anxieties, hopes and passions inexorably bleed into it. I won the [National Academy of Sciences Schmidt Prize for Excellence in Science Communication](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/national-academies-announce-inaugural-recipients-of-eric-and-wendy-schmidt-awards-for-excellence-in-science-communications-totaling-600000/) for [two](https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/orchids-science-and-culture) [essays](https://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-californiahttps://www.thexylom.com/post/no-more-free-kelp-in-northern-california) in 2022. The rest of my writing can be found [here](https://fxfy.github.io/writing).

In a previous life, I was a biologist at Caltech, and graduated with a Ph.D. in Biology in June 2023. My thesis research into animal regeneration from an evolutionary-developmental perspective—or how animals make and re-make themselves.

I’m **OPEN TO WORK** and currently freelancing and taking on contract roles, though I’d love to hear about any part-time or full-time science communication opportunities as well.

### Evergreen interests:
Weird animals and/or the weird things animals can do, obscure science history, neurodivergence and disability, social impacts of science and technology, environment and climate

### Other types of work: 
Scientific manuscript/grant editing, research, factchecking, data analysis
